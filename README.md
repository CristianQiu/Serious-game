# About
This is a Unity project where I developed a serious game for one of my classes at university. It is meant to enhance typing skills while learning to avoid errors on how certain words are written in Spanish.
The tutorial had some videos I decided to not to upload so they will not be displayed under the tutorial option.

The objective of the game is to defeat the enemies and overcome the obstacles while learning the story of the main character. The character moves in the direction you want typing the word that leads to that direction. Note that this was though for kids in between a certain age to enhance both their typing skills and their orthography. The less mistakes made through the game, the more points the player receives at the end of the level.
